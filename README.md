# Tiles
Tiles assignment for CS106B at Stanford Summer Session 2019.
This program simulates a graphic window manager of an operating sytem and allows users to move windows (or tiles) to the front, back, highlight a window, remove a window, merge multiple windows under the cursor. Tiles are stored as a doubly-linked list with its x and y coordinate on screen, width, height, and color.
